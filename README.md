# figma-code-transformer

Figma Plugin to generate code using OpenAI API.

NOTE: as of right now, OpenAI API does not seem to generate code in good quality with gpt-3.5-turbo.

## To Develop

First create .env file and set your OpenAI API key and GitHub API key, repository owner and name where you would want to push result code.

```
$ cp .env.sample .env
```

Build Plugin with the following commands

```
$ npm install --legacy-peer-deps
$ npm run build
```

To watch for code changes and rebuild the plugin automatically:

```
$ npm run watch
```

Then install the plugin in Figma

1. In the Figma desktop app, open a Figma document.
2. Search for and run `Import plugin from manifestâ€¦` via the Quick Actions search bar.
3. Select the `manifest.json` file that was generated by the `build` script.
